Healthcare Data Analysis and Disease Prediction:
# CKD-Predictor
A machine learning-based system to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using patient health metrics. This project uses Support Vector Machine(SVM) for classification and visualization tools to deliver accurate predictions and insightful reports.

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values and scales features for better model performance.  
- **Visualization:** Displays data insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- **Feature Selection:**  Use techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection.  
- **PDF Report Generation:** Generates a detailed report with input data, scaled values, and predictions.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, FPDF  
- **Framework:** Flask  

## How It Works  
1. Input patient metrics through a web interface.  
2. Features are preprocessed and scaled for model prediction.  
3. Predicts whether the patient has CKD or not.  
4. Generates a downloadable PDF report with all details.

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kerissa23/CKD-Predictor.git
   cd CKD-Predictor
